# XMLParserExample

### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RowlandOti/XMLParserExample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RowlandOti/XMLParserExample)


An XML Parser example app
Retrieve XML dat and display downloaded content in app.

### Requirements

The source code compiles with Java 8, hence it requires setting the %JAVA8% variable

### Architecture

Uses clean code architecture with MVC. The code is separated by layer(Domain, data and presentation layers) and then by feature. Right now , it only has one feature i.e downloadfeature. This organisation is extensible and maintainable, because of this kind of separation of concerns. It works in favour of organising coding teams by features or layers.
